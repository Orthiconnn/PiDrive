# PiDrive Navigation Fix Summary

## Issue Found
When navigating to subfolders, the web interface was throwing an error:
```
TypeError: data.filter is not a function
```

This happened because:
1. When a folder didn't exist, the server returned `{ error: 'Directory not found' }`
2. The client code tried to call `.filter()` on this error object before checking if it was an array

## Fix Applied
Updated the error handling in `fetchFiles()` function to:
1. Check if the response data is an array before attempting to filter it
2. During auto-refresh, preserve existing files instead of clearing them on error
3. This prevents the UI from breaking when temporary mount issues occur

## Code Change
```javascript
// Before (problematic):
const data = await response.json();
const filteredFiles = data.filter(f => !f.name.startsWith('.'));

// After (fixed):
const data = await response.json();

// Ensure data is an array
if (!Array.isArray(data)) {
    console.error('Invalid response format:', data);
    if (!isAutoRefresh) {
        setFiles([]);
    }
    return;
}

const filteredFiles = data.filter(f => !f.name.startsWith('.'));
```

## Result
- ✅ Subfolder navigation now works without page refreshes
- ✅ Error responses are handled gracefully
- ✅ Auto-refresh continues working even during temporary mount failures
- ✅ UI stays stable when navigating through folders

## Testing
You can now:
1. Navigate into subfolders without the page refreshing
2. Files added/removed via USB or SMB will update without losing your current folder location
3. The breadcrumb navigation works properly to go back to parent folders
